        <h1>Looking back 2022-23</h1>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>Global Economy</h2>
        <p>
            Central banks worldwide responded to a widespread increase in global inflation by implementing monetary policy measures such as consecutive interest rate hikes and reducing liquidity. These actions resulted in tightened financial conditions, combined with other factors, and had a negative impact on economic growth. As reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth rate declined from 6.2 percent in 2021 to 3.4 percent in 2022. However, by early 2022, the economy had begun to recover from the effects of multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to substantial policy stimulus and the expanded reach of vaccination efforts. Unfortunately, the upturn was disrupted by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The progress achieved through coordinated fiscal and monetary interventions during the pandemic period in 2020 and 2021 was diminished due to the repercussions of the war.
        </p>

        <p>
            The occurrence of global spillovers had a notable impact on Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), leading to significant currency depreciations, capital flight, heightened investor risk aversion, and increased debt distress in certain EMEs. The surge in borrowing costs and prevailing risk-off sentiments placed a considerable burden on EMEs, resulting in substantial outflows from both bond and equity markets throughout the year.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2022, there was a notable increase in global inflation, rising from 4.7 percent in 2021 to 8.7 percent, surpassing targets in most countries. The growth rate of global trade, encompassing both goods and services, decelerated from 10.4 percent in 2021 to 5.1 percent in 2022. This slowdown can be attributed to the post-pandemic decrease in global demand and the limitations imposed on the movement of goods and services across borders due to the war in Ukraine.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>Indian economy</h2>
        <p>
            The Indian economy is projected to have achieved a real GDP growth of 7.0 percent in the fiscal year 2022-23. However, the year-on-year growth rate has been tempered due to unfavorable base effects, a decline in private consumption demand caused by high inflation, a slowdown in export growth, and ongoing pressures related to input costs.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the fiscal year 2022-23, the agriculture and allied sectors exhibited resilience, witnessing a growth of 3.3 percent in gross value added (GVA). Although there was a slight decrease in kharif foodgrains production due to the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of the southwest monsoon (SWM), the production of kharif oilseeds, sugarcane, and cotton showed an increase. Additionally, rabi acreage expanded for most crops, and the prospects for rabi crop production, including both food grains and oilseeds, remain promising. However, it's worth noting that certain parts of the country experienced damage due to unseasonal rains in March 2023. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Within the industrial sector, manufacturing activity demonstrated resilience despite global spillovers. Robust growth was observed in electricity generation, while mining maintained a steady level of activity. Construction activity displayed sustained momentum, and infrastructure and capital goods production received a boost from government-led investments. However, the production of consumer goods remained subdued, and the recovery in sectors such as automobiles was uneven.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the initial months of the year, there was a significant surge in global prices of crude oil, food, fertilisers, and metals. Additionally, the repercussions of the war led to renewed disruptions in supply chains, resulting in widespread inflationary pressures. In April 2022, inflation peaked at 7.8 percent. However, as global supply chains gradually normalised and global commodity prices softened, combined with targeted supply management measures implemented by the government and successive policy repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank, inflation moderated in the latter half of the year. Consequently, headline inflation for the fiscal year 2022-23 increased to 6.7 percent from 5.5 percent in 2021-22. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In April 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) adjusted its stance to focus on controlling inflation while also supporting economic growth. Throughout the fiscal year 2022-23, the MPC implemented a series of policy changes, resulting in an increase of 250 basis points in the policy repo rate, raising it from 4.00 percent to 6.50 percent. Additionally, the lower bound of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor saw a 40 basis points increase in April 2022. As a result of these cumulative policy actions, the overnight weighted average call money rate, which serves as the operational objective of monetary policy, rose by 320 basis points over the course of the year, fully reflecting the combined effects of these policy measures.
        </p>

        <p>
            Government finances were managed with a focus on prudence. The gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of the central government declined from 6.75 percent of GDP in 2021-22 to 6.45 percent of GDP in 2022-23 (as per revised estimates), aided by the withdrawal of pandemic-related stimulus measures that shielded domestic consumers from the effects of the war in Ukraine. Despite increased subsidy expenses, the government prioritised capital expenditure (capex) as a cornerstone of its spending strategy. Consequently, the ratio of revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) improved from 6.0 in 2021-22 to 5.6 in 2022-23 (as per revised estimates). Similarly, the ratio of revenue expenditure to capital expenditure further improved to 4.7 in 2022-23 (as per revised estimates), compared to 5.4 in 2021-22. Tax revenues remained strong, surpassing budget estimates by â‚¹2.9 lakh crore, driven by robust collections from goods and services tax (GST) and direct taxes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            During the fiscal year, India experienced an expansion in its merchandise trade deficit; however, the rate of increase decelerated in the second half of the year. Despite prolonged geopolitical tensions and a slowdown in global trade, India's merchandise exports reached US$450.4 billion in 2022-23, marking a 6.7 percent increase compared to the previous year's record level. Notably, sectors such as mobile phones, toys, and defence goods witnessed significant export growth, with defence goods exports experiencing a tenfold increase within a short period. These achievements were facilitated by initiatives like 'Make in India' and 'AatmaNirbhar Bharat.' On the other hand, India's merchandise imports exhibited high growth during the first half of the year but decelerated in the latter half. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast to merchandise exports, services exports experienced robust growth of 27.9 percent. This growth was primarily driven by software services in key sectors such as information technology (IT) services, business process management (BPM), and engineering research and design (ER&D). Additionally, the rise in global capability centres (GCCs) provided further support to the growth of services exports. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of capital flows, although foreign direct investment (FDI) witnessed robust performance, the net inflows of FDI were lower in 2022-23 at US$28.0 billion compared to US$38.6 billion in the previous year. Additionally, there were net outflows in portfolio investments amounting to US$5.9 billion, indicating a risk-averse sentiment that affected capital flows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) as an asset class. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Contrary to market concerns about potential spikes in India's external vulnerabilities, the current account deficit (CAD) stood at a sustainable level of 2.7 percent of GDP during April-December 2022, although it expanded from 1.1 percent compared to the previous year. As a result of these developments, coupled with lower net capital inflows compared to the previous year, there was a reduction in foreign exchange reserves amounting to US$14.7 billion on a balance of payments (BoP) basis during April-December 2022. However, when factoring in valuation effects, India's foreign exchange reserves declined by US$28.9 billion over the course of 2022-23. 
        </p>

        <p>
            India has demonstrated increased strength and resilience in the aftermath of the pandemic, partially attributed to the wave of digital transformation. During the fiscal year 2022-23, total digital payments experienced remarkable growth, with a 57.8 percent increase in volume and a 19.2 percent increase in value compared to the previous year's growth rates of 63.8 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively. This growth was primarily driven by the significant expansion and adoption of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which benefited from the swift onboarding of merchants, heightened digital awareness, and policy initiatives aimed at enhancing the scope and accessibility of payment systems.

        <h1>Prospects 2023-2024</h1>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>Global economy</h2>
        <p>
            In 2023, global economic growth is projected to decelerate and remain subdued in the medium term. According to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) World Economic Outlook (WEO) report published in April 2023, global growth is expected to reach 2.8 percent in 2023, followed by a plateauing at 3.0 percent in the medium term. Efforts to combat disinflation are anticipated to reduce headline inflation from 7.3 percent to 4.7 percent among advanced economies (AEs) and from 9.8 percent to 8.6 percent among emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) globally. Central banks are confronted with a challenging dilemma of balancing the restoration of price stability with addressing the slowdown in growth, all amidst a backdrop of heightened uncertainty. Potential financial risks arising from high levels of debt and recent developments in the banking sectors of the United States and Europe underscore the possibility of unforeseen stress accumulation, leading to significant adverse spillovers across the global financial system.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a likelihood of depreciation in the value of the US dollar, which could alleviate pressures on the currencies of other advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs), especially as the outlook for capital flows to EMEs remains uncertain amid moderated policy tightening by global central banks. Financial markets are currently indicating the potential conclusion of the global monetary policy tightening cycle, as equity prices recover from previous losses and bond yields ease. Additionally, commodity prices are displaying a tendency to soften as market sentiments are dominated by concerns of a growth slowdown.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, the outlook for the global economy remains overshadowed by high inflation and the negative impacts of geo-economic fragmentation. This fragmentation is manifested through various restrictions on the movement of trade, labor, capital, and technology diffusion, which can potentially amplify vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Furthermore, there are medium- to long-term challenges such as climate change, cyber security, cryptocurrencies, financial technology (FinTech), and technological disruptions that have the potential to further complicate the outlook.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>Indian Economy</h2>
        <p>
            Risks to inflation have become less pronounced as global commodity and food prices have undergone downward corrections, and the pressure from high input costs experienced last year has eased. The cumulative increase of 250 basis points in the policy repo rate during the previous year is expected to guide the disinflationary process, supplemented by measures addressing temporary imbalances between demand and supply caused by food and energy shocks. Assuming a stable exchange rate and a normal monsoon season, unless there is an occurrence of an El NiÃ±o event, it is anticipated that the trajectory of inflation will decline throughout 2023-24. As a result, headline inflation is projected to decrease to 5.2 percent from the average level of 6.7 percent recorded in the previous year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reconfiguration of global supply chains, the shift towards sustainable energy, and the continuous progress in technology create a favourable environment for an increase in investment activity and the enhancement of productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The growing expansion of credit, particularly in housing and personal loans, indicates a stable demand from domestic households. This is evident in various high-frequency indicators of both rural and urban demand, such as increased sales of tractors and fertilisers, improved labor participation rates in rural areas, rising domestic air passenger traffic, higher sales of passenger vehicles, and robust collections from goods and services tax. The positive outlook for rural demand is further supported by strong agricultural production, driven by expectations of a fruitful rabi harvest, and resilience in allied sectors. Construction activity is expected to maintain its momentum, as indicated by steady growth in steel consumption and cement production, while port cargo traffic and railway freight traffic movements suggest a pickup in industrial activity amidst gradual alleviation of input cost pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The outlook for the kharif crop will be contingent on the progress of rainfall during the southwest monsoon (SWM) season. According to the forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the SWM rainfall from June to September 2023 is expected to be normal, reaching approximately 96 percent (+/- 4 percent) of the long period average (LPA). The actual performance of the SWM rainfall will have a significant impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government has set a target for total foodgrain production in 2023-24, aiming for 332 million tonnes, which is 0.4 percent higher than the third advance estimate of the previous year's production. Additionally, with the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) designating 2023 as the international year of millets, India has the opportunity to enhance the export potential of millets. Currently, only one percent of the total millet production is exported.
        </p>
        <p>
            The services sector is expected to maintain a positive outlook in 2023-24. Following the pandemic, there has been a revival in the real estate and construction sectors, and they are anticipated to continue performing well this year. Both the demand for and supply of housing remain strong, contributing to the buoyancy in these sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the external sector, the volatility of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows may continue due to ongoing global uncertainties. However, the current account deficit (CAD) is projected to remain at a moderate level, benefiting from the strong performance of services exports and the positive impact of lower commodity prices for imports. Furthermore, the favorable domestic growth outlook, lower inflation, and business-friendly policy reforms could potentially support and sustain robust inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).
        </p>
        <p>
            The recently announced Foreign Trade Policy (FTP), 2023, which was unveiled on March 31, 2023, aims to create a favorable environment for exports, nurturing India's comparative advantage. It seeks to leverage opportunities presented by bilateral trade agreements, allowing India to participate in global value chains (GVCs) and gain access to new markets. Additionally, the policy emphasises exploring more trade conducted in the Indian rupee (INR). As the World Trade Organisation (WTO) projects a slowdown in global trade volume growth from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.7 percent in 2023, it becomes crucial to make progress on all key areas outlined in the FTP.
        </p>
        <p>
            India's payment systems are witnessing ongoing developments and advancements. To facilitate seamless transactions, the scope of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) will be expanded to include payments from pre-sanctioned credit lines at banks. Additionally, there are plans to migrate the Cheque Truncation System (CTS) from the existing three regional grids to a unified "One Nation One Grid" system. Moving forward, while continuing to prioritise innovation and customer protection, the focus will be on promoting inclusion and internationalisation. The Reserve Bank of India aims to increase the reach of payment systems for cross-border payments and remittances. The establishment of linkages with fast payment systems in other jurisdictions, similar to the UPI-PayNow linkage with Singapore, is currently being explored.
