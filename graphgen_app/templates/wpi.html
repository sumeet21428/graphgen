    <h1> Review </h1>
    &nbsp;
    <p>
        Wholesale price inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), experienced a significant surge in H1: 2022-23, reaching its highest point of 16.6 percent in May 2022. This increase was in line with the global pattern of rising prices for crude oil and other commodities following the conflict in Ukraine. However, as global commodity prices, particularly in energy, food, and metals, started to soften in the latter part of the year, WPI inflation consistently moderated. By March 2023, it had declined to 1.3 percent, falling below the headline inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI).
    </p>

    <p>
        With the easing of wholesale price index (WPI) inflation starting from October 2022, the inflation measured by the GDP deflator also experienced moderation. In Q3: 2022-23, GDP deflator inflation declined to 6.6 percent from 10.3 percent in Q2: 2022-23. Looking at the overall picture for the year 2022-23, GDP deflator inflation moderated to 8.3 percent, down from 8.5 percent compared to the previous year.
    </p>

    <h2> Conclusion : inflation </h2>

    <p>
        India experienced sustained upward price pressures as a result of common shocks originating from the war in Ukraine, such as elevated food, energy, and commodity prices. The global inflationary environment reaching multi-decadal highs also contributed to this trend. As a consequence, inflation in India remained above the upper tolerance level of 6 percent for 10 consecutive months from January to October 2022. However, there was some relief in November-December 2022 with a seasonal easing in food prices, although inflation rose again in January-February 2023 before moderating to 5.7 percent in March 2023. The tightening of monetary policies by major economies and the resulting volatility in financial markets also contributed to imported inflationary pressures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Core inflation was affected by input cost pressures stemming from elevated prices of industrial raw materials, increased transportation costs, and disruptions in global logistics and supply chains.
    </p>

    <p>
        The inflationary pressures caused by an early onset of summer, heat waves, and unseasonal rains on food prices during the first half of the year subsided in the second half. This was due to a strong kharif harvest, the arrival of fresh crops in the market, and a slight easing in global food prices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The government's proactive supply-side interventions played a crucial role in managing price pressures. Additionally, the timely initiation of the monetary policy tightening cycle, with a cumulative increase of 250 basis points in the policy repo rate since May 2022, helped alleviate demand pressures, anchor inflation expectations, and mitigate the secondary effects of consecutive supply shocks. Without these timely monetary measures, inflation is estimated to have been higher by 90 basis points. However, the outlook for inflation in India remains clouded by geopolitical dynamics and potential weather disturbances.
